## Capstone Data
* Name: 2019 Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) Program funded projects 
* Description: I've been collecting data on projects which were funded by the ORLP. The ORLP goal is to decrease park poverty in underserved communities by awarding a competitive grant to urban areas with a population of 50,000 or more. 
  * I've collected descriptive statistics of projects awarded funding in 2019 and I've collected the Latitute and Longitude coordinates to map these locations and understand the spatial equity. This can hopefully eventually be used as an interactive tool by my project sponsor, the Wilderness Society.

## 2010 Census Urban Areas and Clusters
* Name: 2010 Census Urban Areas and Clusters
* Description: Another data source for my capstone project. Because the ORLP requires that potential projects be in urban areas with a population of 50,000 or more, applicants must use the 2010 Census Urban Areas and Clusters to provide proof that their outdoor recreation oppoturnity will serve the appropriate population.
