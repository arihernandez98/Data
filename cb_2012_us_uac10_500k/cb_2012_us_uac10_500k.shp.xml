         <abstract>The 2012 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER geographic database. These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based shapefiles while others are available only as state-based files. </abstract>
         <purpose>To improve the appearance of shapes at small scales, areas are represented with fewer vertices than detailed TIGER/Line equivalents.  These boundary files take up less disk space than their ungeneralized counterparts.  Cartographic boundary files take less time to render on screen.  These files were specifically created to support small-scale thematic mapping.</purpose>

      <logic>The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency of the source database.  Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area.  All polygons were tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files.  Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.</logic>
      <complete>The Cartographic Boundary Files are generalized representations of extracts taken from the MAF/TIGER Database. Generalized boundary files are clipped to a simplified version of the U.S. outline. As a result, some off-shore areas may be excluded from the generalized files. Some small holes or discontiguous parts of areas are not included in generalized files.</complete>

      <overview>
         <eaover>The cartographic boundary polygon shapefiles contain boundary data for a specific type of Census geography.  See the U.S. Census Bureau Geographic Terms and Concepts documentation for further explanation of Census geography (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/2010census/GTC_10.pdf).  
Below is a list of possible fields.  Attribution will vary depending on the type of geography.  Field names, descriptions and data types are listed in this format:  FIELD_NAME Description [data value or type].
AFFGEOID AFF Summary Level Code, nation identifier; nation FIPS code [string]; AFFGEOID10 2010 Census AFF Summary Level Code, nation identifier; nation FIPS code [string]; ALAND Current land area [number]; ALAND10 2010 Census land area [number]; CD113FP 113th congressional district FIPS code [string]; CDSESSN 113th congressional session code [string]; GEOID identifier, code [string]; GEOID10 2010 Census identifier, 2010 Census code [string]; LSAD Current name and the translated legal/statistical area description code [string]; LSAD10 2010 Census name and the translated legal/statistical area description code [string]; LSY Legislative session year [string]; NAME10 2010 Census name [string]; NAMELSAD Current name and the translated legal/statistical area description [string]; NAMELSAD10 2010 Census name and the translated legal/statistical area description [string]; SLDLST Current state legislative district lower chamber code [string]; SLDUST Current state legislative district upper chamber code [string]; STATEFP Current state FIPS code [string]; UACE10 2010 Census urban area code [string]; UATYP10 2010 Census urban area type [string].
The ALAND or ALAND10 field is the calculated area derived from the ungeneralized area of each entity in square miles.  This field can be used in density calculations.  Users should not calculate the area of the generalized polygons for use in any analysis.  Use the GEOID field to join these spatial tables to 2010 Census data tables if needed.  
Some nation-based files may include Puerto Rico and the Island Areas of the United States.  Island areas include American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Northern Mariana Islands), and the United States Virgin Islands.</eaover>
